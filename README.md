# OpenGL Practice

## Purpose
I wanted to learn OpenGL because I consider it interesting! Moreso than that, I believe that it is an underpinning of modern software development, especially in game development, and that knowing how things work allows for better programming even if it is not something I will use directly. (Here, I am not necessarily talking about OpenGL specifically, but about all graphics APIs that are similar).

## Benefits
My goal was to learn OpenGL and that is what I am doing. There is a lot of information to learn, but through the help of very useful documentation from docs.gl, tutorials online, and helpful veterans, I have slowly been increasing my knowledge of this program and general concepts of others graphics APIs. 

## Status
This is an ongoing project. It is not related to my schooling or work directly, so it is updated based on my free time to work on it.
